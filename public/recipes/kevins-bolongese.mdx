# Rich & Rustic Spaghetti Bolognese

This isn't your average weeknight red sauce — this is a rich, slow-cooked Bolognese that hits with layers of flavor: garlic, wine, aromatics, and the perfect touch of cream. It's humble, hearty, and dangerously addictive.

## Ingredients

**Aromatics:**

- 1 medium white onion, finely diced
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced

**Meat:**

- 1 lb ground beef (80/20 preferred, 93/7 is great too)
- Optional: ¼ lb ground pork or Italian sausage

**Sauce Base:**

- 1/2 cup dry red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon is great)
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 can (28 oz) peeled San Marzano tomatoes (crushed)
- 1/2 cup whole milk or heavy cream
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp red chili flakes (optional)
- 1 bay leaf

**Pasta:**

- 12 oz spaghetti
- Salt for pasta water
- Reserved pasta water (about 1/2 cup)

**Finishing:**

- Grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano
- Fresh parsley or basil
- Olive oil drizzle (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Sauté the Aromatics**:  
   In a large skillet or pot, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over medium. Add onion, carrot, and celery with a pinch of salt. Cook until softened, about 7-8 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.

2. **Brown the Meat**:  
   Push veggies to one side, add ground beef (and pork if using) to the other. Brown thoroughly, breaking it up as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper. Mix with veggies once browned.

3. **Deglaze with Wine**:  
   Pour in the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to lift all the flavor bits. Let it simmer for 2 minutes, reducing slightly.

4. **Build the Sauce**:  
   Stir in tomato paste, cook for 1 minute. Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, chili flakes, and bay leaf. Stir everything together.

5. **Simmer Low & Slow**:  
   Reduce heat to low and simmer partially covered for 30-45 minutes, stirring every 10. If it gets too thick, add a splash of water or wine.

6. **Finish with Milk**:  
   Stir in milk or cream in the last 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning — salt, pepper, or a pinch of sugar if needed.

7. **Cook Pasta**:  
   Boil spaghetti in salted water until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.

8. **Combine & Serve**:  
   Toss pasta with the sauce in the pan, adding pasta water as needed for perfect consistency. Plate with Parmesan, herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil if you're feelin' extra.

## Tips

- **Wine Choice:** Use a red you'd actually drink — the flavor concentrates as it cooks.
- **Next-Day Glory:** Leftovers taste even better after a night in the fridge.
- **Optional Upgrade:** Add a Parmesan rind during the simmer for extra umami.

Enjoy with a glass of whatever wine you just cooked with, and soak in the compliments. Enjoy!
