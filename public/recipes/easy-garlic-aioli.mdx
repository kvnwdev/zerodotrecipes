This garlic aioli is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser—it's creamy, garlicky, tangy, and has just the right depth of flavor. Perfect for fries, sandwiches, burgers, or honestly anything edible.

## Ingredients

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
- Juice from ¼ lemon (for that perfect tang)
- ½ tsp Dijon mustard (adds depth)
- ½ tsp Osmo garlic salt (to taste)
- ¼ tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 tsp olive oil
- ¼ cup shredded parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. **Prep Garlic**: Mince the garlic cloves finely. The finer, the better!

2. **Mix Together**: Combine mayo, minced garlic, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic salt, black pepper, olive oil, and parmesan in a bowl. Mix until smooth and evenly blended.

3. **Chill & Meld**: Pop the aioli into the fridge for about 10-15 minutes. This step is important, but not absolutely necessary–letting those flavors mingle and intensify is what elevates this from great to incredible.

4. **Final Check**: Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Remember: this aioli is yours so tweak it until it's perfect!

## Tips

- **Taste, taste, taste!** These ingredients blend amazingly, but don’t be shy to make adjustments to fit your palate.
- Try these awesome variations I’m planning to experiment with:
  - **Spicy Aioli**: Kick it up with a splash of Sriracha or a pinch of cayenne.
  - **Herb Aioli**: Toss in fresh parsley and basil for a garden-fresh twist.
  - **Truffle Aioli**: Elevate your aioli game with a drop or two of truffle oil. Fancy, right?

Enjoy!
